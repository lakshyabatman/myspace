## Indian workspaces hate you having a life or a hobby

You must've heard "taking ownership", "going ahead", or "good for your career" a lot at your workspace.  
What does it mean to you or them? For the past 6–7 years of working as a software engineer, whether as a full-time engineer, intern, or consultant, I've seen leadership giving a look whenever you mention having a hobby or taking time for other parts of your life except work.

We've been colonised and enslaved for so many years that the mindset is still rooted in our nature now. We've glorified hustling to such an extent that the only time we are okay taking time off is when we're physically sick.

I've seen people taking pride in working overnight or on weekends for a rare occasion but meaningless tasks which won't affect anything at all.

The issue sets a mindset of seeing Indians as "cheap and hardworking labour", which has risen across the industry and the world. A common assumption among many people is that "Indians like to work", and over time this sets up similar expectations from other colleagues.

**But why bother?**

Brain drain.

Hobbies are what keep people alive. When everything is tracked with numbers and monetary values, then hobbies are what make these rats back into humans. Innovation comes from things which have meaning and passion, not from spreadsheets or blank screens of business-impact code.

One example which always comes to my mind is the creation of Linux. It was a hobby project and not led by a big corporation that thinks in terms of 9–9 work hours and increasing stakeholder value for someone in a different timezone.

Personally, I've seen a rise in mental and physical health issues among people. Folks have lost interest in anything—no hobbies—just being cultivated as rats by others.

Another aspect is AI in the workspace. AI makes life easier and makes work easier, absolutely. Tasks which took weeks are now being completed in hours, but do we live in an ideal world? Leadership that brings up these points always forgets that tasks never finish. They keep coming—no problem-solving or creativity, just **prompts to output**.

A hustle-glorified Indian workspace culture has shaped us from rats into rats on a wheel.

**Is there any end to it?**

As far as I can see, no. Can you set boundaries? Yes, but you'll be seen as an outcast and slowly pushed away, or you end up in a better culture.

Is there any life after this? Maybe.
