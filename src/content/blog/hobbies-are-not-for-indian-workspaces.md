## Indian workspaces hate you having a life or a hobby

You must've heard "taking ownership", "going ahead" or "good for your career" alot at your workspace. 
What does it mean to you or them? For past 6-7 years of working as software engineer, whether as FTE engineer, intern or just as consultant I've seen leadership giving a look whenever you mentioned about having a hobby or taking time for other parts of your life except work. 

We've been colonised and were slaved for so many years that the mindset is still in root into our nature now, we've glorified hustling to an extent that the only time we are okay taking time of is only when we're physically sick. 

I've seen people taking pride of working overnight or weekends for a rare occasion but meaningless tasks which won't affect anything at all.

The issue sets mindset of seeing Indians as "cheap and hard working labour" rose enough all across the industry and world. Common assumption from majority of people is that "Indians like to work" and they over the time sets up similar expectations from other fellows.

**But why bother?**

Brain drain. 

Hobbies is what keeps people alive. Whene everything is tracked with numbers and monetory values then hobbies is what makes these rats back into human. Innovations come from things which have meaning and passion and not from sheets or blank screen of business impact code. 

One of the example which always comes to my mind is creation of Linux, it was a hobby project and not led by big corperation who thinks from 9-9 works hours and increasing stakeholder values of a person in different timezone.


Personally I've seen rise of mental or physical health issues among people, folks have lost interest in anything, no hobbies just they are being cultivated as rats by others. 

One another aspect is AI into workspace. AI makes life easier and makes work easier, absolutely. Tasks which took weeks are now being completed in hours but do we live in ideal world ? Leadership who brings these points always forgets that tasks never finishes, they'll keep on coming, no problem solving or creativity but just **prompts to output**.

Hustling glorified Indian workspace culture shaped us from rats into rats on a wheel.

**Is there any end to it?**

As far as I can see, No. Can you set boundaries? Yes, but you'll be seen as outcast and slowly will be pushed away or you just end up in a better culture. 

Is there any life after this? Maybe.
