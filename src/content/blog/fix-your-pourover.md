description: How to fix your pourovers and brew better
---

### Pourovers are integral part of my life, without it I'm nothing.

I started my coffee journey with a cheap hand grinder and a Hario v60.

Today I have bunch of tools and I still use same v60.

Earlier when I started the coffee used to taste like coffee now I can differentiate body, notes and acidity.

I can help you to do as well...

There are certains pointers which you need to understand to improve or upgrade your pourover experience.

- Coffee
	- Just like your ex love partner some coffee are not fixable, no matter what you do a bad coffee can't be brewed well.
	- Move on and invest in fresh coffee, fine any roasters available nearby and get a fresh bag of beans.
	- Understanding choosing coffee is like dating, sometimes good and sometimes bad, based on coffee you might have to tweak your recipe. You can't be same with everyone.
- Grinder
	- No ground coffee please as it gets stale quickly, if you don't want to invest in a grinder now, get them grinded in person so atleast your coffee has more shelf life.
	- Invest in a good grinder. I don't mean to giveaway all your life savings but get a decent grinder, eg: Timemore C2
- Water temperature
	- As mentioned it depends on the coffee, usually I brew between 90-94c for most of the coffee.
	- I personally love fermented/naturals coffee so I need to brew at higher temperature.
	- Understand this:
		- Washed coffee are easier to extract than naturals so it requires lesser temperature.
- Pourover type
	- With the market expanding you can new versions of Pourovers. Some has flow controls, different shapes, different materials and pattern.
	- But you're good with the most basic one in my opinion.
    - If you want to get a new pourover, you can check out [Somethings Brewing](https://somethingsbrewing.in/) with code `brewedsneakers`.
- Ratio
	- Imo, Ive been very happy with 1:16 usually, sometimes in case more naturals/fermentated coffee I went till 1:18.


At the end of the day, it's you and your rabbit hole to dive into.

But I can share my general recipe.
- 1:17 ratio
- 18g coffee
- 90-92c water
- Medium fine grind
- Bloom till 1min to 50g of water
- Slow remaining pour till the end
- Swirl 30-40s 
- Serve

Happy brewing !
