description: What I am using to brew my perfect cup of life ;)
---

### I drink coffee everyday, no skips. I don't prefer instant coffee.

For me brewing is an art of meditation, I enjoy my cup of coffee before dealing with product managers (jk). 

Right now as per 19th May 2024. Im using few tools to brew my coffee.

- *Fellow EKG kettle (white colour)*
    - It is used for almost all kind of brewing, I love the ergonomics and the aesthetics of it, it has temperature control which is beautiful when it comes to precision.
- *Hario V60*
    - The real pourover tool, gives me good acidity and body in my coffee, have been using unbleached paper to get the most of oils from the coffee.
- *Hario Switch*
    - Best of both immersion and percolation, not using it often.
- *Aeropress*
    - I have a love and hate relationship with this beast, I prefer brewing using inversion technique. I usually pick it when IAC is around.
- *Mokapot*
    - To brew more strong espresso like coffee for milk based and cocktails.
- *French Press*
    - Sorry but I use it to froth milk.
- *South Indian Filter*
    - I used it for those late night coding session, when I need the kick of chicory.
- *Timemore C2 grinder*
    - My second grinder and the only grinder I own right now, I get good grinds from it and I can recommend for any newbie.
- *Hoffen scale*
    - Cheapest and great scale I got from amazon, extremely happy with it.
