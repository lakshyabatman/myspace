description: Just an introduction about this cute little space on internet.

### Hello World!

Printed on the console while I was trying to learn programming approx 6 years ago. My mind couldn't how far I will reach from trying to be a hacker to sr. software engineer. 

**This blog is my unhinged space on internet. I want to write about coffee, tech, coding, my personal experiences, book summaries, self improvement, my thoughts, stars anything ;)**

### Why I chose AstroBuild
Seemed a little cool and the was very easy to setup and get started.
